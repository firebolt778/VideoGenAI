Thumbnail Template Page


Initially, I can only think of 4 thumbnail types: First image, random image, last image, and AI generated image. The first 3 can be made as part of the development process, and don't really need to be adjustable via this Thumbnail page, as far as I can forsee. This page is mainly so I can make custom prompts for various categories, like Ghost stories.


Required Functions:

Thumbnail Template Name (save the thumbnail settings)

Image Generation Prompt (prompt box to generate images specifically tailored for thumbnails using GPT-4o or Flux)

Model Selection (choose primary and fallback image-generation models)

Fallback Strategy (automatic fallback to the first or last image of the video if AI generation fails)

Thumbnail Testing (preview and generate test thumbnails locally, without publishing)
